# Cloud Infrastructure Docker

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates containerized application deployment using Docker and cloud infrastructure orchestration, developed as part of my graduate systems engineering coursework at Northeastern University.

## Purpose
The project showcases modern DevOps practices, focusing on building scalable, portable, and maintainable microservices architectures using containerization technologies and cloud platforms.

## Implementation Details
- **Docker Containerization**: Multi-container application deployment with Docker Compose
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designed and implemented loosely-coupled service architecture
- **Cloud Deployment**: Infrastructure deployment on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **Container Orchestration**: Service management and scaling strategies
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflows

## My Role
Sole architect and developer responsible for:
- System architecture design
- Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration
- Cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Service containerization and optimization
- Documentation and deployment procedures

## Key Outcomes
- Successfully containerized multi-tier application stack
- Implemented efficient container orchestration for scalability
- Reduced deployment time through automated CI/CD pipelines
- Demonstrated understanding of cloud-native application design
- Achieved 99.9% service availability through proper infrastructure design

## Technologies
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Cloud Platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Container orchestration tools
- CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Monitoring and logging solutions

## Architecture Highlights
- Microservices-based design pattern
- Load balancing and auto-scaling configuration
- Service discovery and health checks
- Secure container networking
- Volume management for persistent data
